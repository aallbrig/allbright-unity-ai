# Andrew Allbright AI library

Open up the unity package manager in the unity editor.

Copy this URL to the Allbright AI library. Ensure there are no extra characters such as spaces.
```
https://github.com/aallbrig/allbright-unity-ai.git?path=/unity/allbright-unity-ai/Packages/com.allbright.ai
```

Hit the package manager's plus sign + to "Add package from git URL." Paste in the git URL above.

### Tips
- Use quick search (option + ') to search for "Package Manager." Unity should request to install unity quick search upon first usage. Such a time saver!
